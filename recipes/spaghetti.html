  <h2>HOW TO MAKE SPAGHETTI</h2></br>
<p>Our spaghetti has a delicious sauce recipe with just a hint of sweetness. The sauce takes some time since you simmer it for almost an hour, but I promise itâ€™s worth it.</p>
<ul>
 <li><em><strong>GROUND BEEF.</strong></em>Brown the hamburger in a large pan. Drain the fat if desired.</li>
 <li><em><strong>SAUCE.</strong></em>Throw in salt, pepper, tomato sauce and paste, water (with the bouillon cubes in it or beef broth in the can), sugar, basil, oregano, and garlic. Simmer on low for 45 minutes to an hour.</li>
 <li><em><strong>PASTA.</strong></em>Twenty minutes before the hour is up, cook the box of spaghetti noodles as directed on the package. Once the noodles are cooked, add them to the sauce and serve right away.</li>
 <P>We like to top our spaghetti with grated (or even shredded) Parmesan cheese and some fresh basil if desired. It truly is so delicious!</P>
 <li><em><strong>Meatless option.</strong></em>If you would like a meatless version, cook the sauce without the hamburger, and just put a tablespoon of olive oil in the pan before adding any other ingredients. You can make Meatballs on the side if some people want the option to add meat!</li>
</ul>

<p>I like to double the recipe and cook it in a slow cooker. I store half of the sauce in the freezer for later! To make in a crock pot:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em><strong>BEEF.</strong></em>Brown the ground beef and add to a crock pot.</li>
  <li><em><strong>SAUCE.</strong></em>Add all of the other sauce ingredients. Cook on LOW for 6-8 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours.</li>
</ul>
